**NB**
1. Make sure in whatever enviroment you are running it on ... that you will need the ffmpeg to be able to encode the mp4 file to ts files for storing on the Object storage.
2. Im using minio for Object storage you can easily start up a local instance using docker.

   Thats it , Happy Coding !! :)
